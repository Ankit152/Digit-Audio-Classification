### Audio ðŸ”Š
Audio is a term used to describe any sound or noise in a range the human ear is capable of hearing. Measured in `hertz`, the audio signal on a computer is generated using a sound card and heard through speakers or headphones.

Any digital information with speech or music stored on and played through a computer is known as an audio file or sound file. One of the most common types of audio file formats used today is the `MP3`.

An audio signal is a representation of sound, typically using either a changing level of electrical voltage for analog signals, or a series of binary numbers for digital signals.
