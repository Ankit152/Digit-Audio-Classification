# Digit Audio Classification 🔢

`A Deep Learning model that classifies digits based on its Audio Input.`

## Audio 🔊
Audio is a term used to describe any sound or noise in a range the human ear is capable of hearing. Measured in `hertz`, the audio signal on a computer is generated using a sound card and heard through speakers or headphones.

Any digital information with speech or music stored on and played through a computer is known as an audio file or sound file. One of the most common types of audio file formats used today is the `MP3`.

An audio signal is a representation of sound, typically using either a changing level of electrical voltage for analog signals, or a series of binary numbers for digital signals.


## Waveplots 〰
These are the waveplots of the digits when we spell it. Please note that we are spelling `one` or any other digit as it should be spelled, not like like `oooooaannee` or something like that. You can also try it once. Its funny though. 😆😆😆😆
